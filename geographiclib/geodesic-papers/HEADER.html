    <h3>Scans of papers on geodesics</h3>
    <p>
      This directory contains scans which fill in some of the gaps in the
      Google Books and other online collections.  It also includes scans
      of those pages in Google Books which are missing or unreadable.
      The description fields within these pdf files provide full
      citations and, where applicable, give links to the corresponding
      Google Books.  Also included are some pdf versions of Google Books
      which others have reported problems obtaining (the "id=" links
      provide the corresponding links to Google Books).  The
      <a href="biblio.html">geodesic bibliography</a>
      contains links to these and many other papers on geodesics.
