    <h3>Helmert, Mathematical and Physical Theories of Higher Geodesy,
      Vol. 2</h3>
    <p>
      Friedrich Robert Helmert, 1843&ndash;1917,<br>
      <i>Die Mathematischen und Physikalischen Theorieen der
	H&ouml;heren Geod&auml;sie [Mathematical and Physical Theories
	of Higher Geodesy]</i>, Vol. 2, The Physical Theories (Teubner,
	Leipzig, 1884).<br>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=p9-CAAAAIAAJ">
	    German edition of Vol. 2 at Google Books</a>
	  (<a href="https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/geodesic-papers/helmert84.pdf">pdf</a>).
	<li>
	  <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.32051">
	    English translation of Vol. 2 by Aeronautical Chart and
	    Information Center (St. Louis, 1964)</a>.
      </ul>
    <p>
      Notes on the English translation:
      <ul>
	<li>
	  This is a scan by Charles Karney of the copy in the USGS
	  library in Reston, VA.
	<li>
	  The table of contents and the cross-references in the text use
	  the page numbers from the original book.  This pagination is
	  indicated in the translation by the numbers above and below
	  the horizontal lines in the text.
	<li>
	  The formulas have been cut and pasted (in the old-fashioned
	  way!) from the book.  In some cases these are barely legible;
	  go to the German text to disambiguate them (see Google Books
	  link above).
	<li>
	  This translation has 1001 pages.  However, the scan is legible
	  when printed 2-up (2 pages per sheet).  This should work OK
	  with A4 and US letter sizes.  (Some pages have light areas or
	  are blurred.  This was a problem with the copy used for the
	  scan.)
	<li>
	  The last two pages are fold-out figures.  You may want to
	  print these on larger paper.
      </ul>
